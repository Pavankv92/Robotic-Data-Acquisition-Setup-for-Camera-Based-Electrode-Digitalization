	\begin{itemize}
		\item Electrode position is important during EEG process.
		\item Several RGBD camera  based electrode detection methods exists [1][2].
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fixed head position.
			\item Time consuming.
		\end{itemize} 
		\item A convolutional neural network (CNNs) based method has been proposed [3].
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accounts for head movement.
			\item Fast detection.
		\end{itemize}
		\item CNNs require a large amount of ground truth data (electrode position).
		\item A robotic data acquisition system is developed for this purpose.
