	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New Kinect is integrated successfully
		\item High degree of accuracy is achieved in hand-eye calibration.
		\item Electrode location can be recorded with accuracy of $<$ $\pm$ 5mm
		\item A large amount of ground turth data generated for 3 EEG caps
		\item These data can used for 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Training and evaluation of CNNs
			\item Evaluation of camera based electrode detection algorithm in general  
		\end{itemize}
		\item Range of electrode position variation for 5 wearing instaces has been exlpored
	\end{itemize}
