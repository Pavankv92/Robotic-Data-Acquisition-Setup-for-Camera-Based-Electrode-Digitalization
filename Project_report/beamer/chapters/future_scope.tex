	\begin{itemize}
		\item Redesigning the reflective marker that can reach all the electrodes without having to move the phantom
		head.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Head movement while mapping introduced measurement error of $<$ $\pm$ 5mm.
				\item Current algorithms works any reflective marker.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Filtering system
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Not all the electrodes can be seen in a single image.
				\item The position of all the electrode
				is recorded in the Kinect frame even the ones that are not visible.
			\end{itemize}
